Avocado Toast with Poached Egg and Smoked Salmon

Ingredients:

2 slices whole grain bread
2 ripe avocados
1/4 cup smoked salmon, flaked
1 egg
Salt and pepper, to taste
Fresh dill, chopped (optional)

Instructions:

Toast the bread slices until lightly browned.
Mash the avocados and spread on top of the toasted bread slices.
Sprinkle the smoked salmon flakes over the avocado.
Poach the egg by cracking it into a pot of simmering water. Cook for 3-4 minutes, until the whites are set and the yolks are still slightly runny. Remove with a slotted spoon and place on top of the avocado.
Season with salt and pepper to taste.
Garnish with chopped fresh dill (if using).
Serve immediately and enjoy!
